Prediction of housing market value using various machine learning and data science techniques

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the market value of residential properties. Using various machine learning techniques and a dataset comprising multiple features of properties, I aimed to provide accurate and reliable price predictions. This project was part of a data science module and a thorough analysis of the data was done with linear regression being applied to get a predictive market value for houses.
